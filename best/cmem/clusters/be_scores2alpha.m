function [alpha, CLS, OPTIONS] = be_scores2alpha(SCR, CLS, OPTIONS, varargin)
%BE_SCORES2ALPHA computes the initial probability of a parcel being active in 
%   the MEM model using the MSP scores of the sources within each patch
%
%   INPUTS:
%       -   SCR     : vector of MSP scores with dimension Nsources
%       -   CLS     : vector of parcel labels for each source (1xNsources)
%       -   OPTIONS : 
%               model.alpha_method  :   method of initialization of the active           
%                   initial parcel active probabilities. (1=mean of MSP scores
%                   of sources within  parcel, 2=max, 3=median, 4=all 
%                   probabilities set to 0.5, 5=all prob. set to 1)
%
%               model.alpha_threshold:  threshold on the active probabilities. 
%                   All prob. < threshold are set to 0 (parcel not part of the 
%                   MEM solution
%
%   OUTPUTS:
%       - OPTIONS   : Keep track of parameters
%       -   ALPHA   : vector of probabilities (1xNparcels)
%       -   CLS     : cell array (1xNparcels). Each cell contains the indices of        
%                     the sources within that parcel
